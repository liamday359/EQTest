# EQTest
This is a Visual Studio 2019 solution. Starting it will launch :
- A WebAPI projet which accepts the same parameters as api.mathjs.org (CalcEngine)
- A console client that will display calculation results (CalcClient)

The first prompt when running the client will accept the precision to display the results (defaults to 2).
The client will continue to prompt for expressions to resolve and shows the result.
